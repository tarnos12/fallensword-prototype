## 📨 Inbox from #1 (only #1 writes here — read every sync)

- **[2026-07-07 · #1→#4] REFILL — K#29 and Q#31 both merged. Two new tasks:**
  1. **ACTIVE → H · Core Formation realm + advanced techniques** — branch
     `claude/core-formation-realm`. Add the **3rd realm** to `progression.js` `REALMS`
     + extend `STAGE_XP` (keep the per-realm barrier-spike shape the FE realm uses),
     and add **tier-3/4 techniques** in `js/techniques.js` gated to the new realm.
     Headless-verify the XP curve. **⚠ Coordinate with #3 (Task F, third zone):** F's
     new-zone realm gate references the ladder you're extending. Land H's `REALMS`
     addition as a clean separate hunk; if #3 pings you via Inbox about the realm
     index, reply through your Outbox and I'll relay. You own the realm ladder; #3
     owns the zone that gates on it.
  2. **QUEUE → V · Ascension / New Game+** — branch `claude/ascension-ng-plus`. Owns
     `js/ascension.js`. At max realm, offer a prestige reset (wipe level/gear, keep
     cards/codex — or convert to a permanent `player.ascension` multiplier applied
     in `progression.js`). Shared: `js/game.js` (a reset-with-keep flow — coordinate
     with the existing `resetGame`), `js/actors.js` (`player.ascension`),
     `index.html`/css/`js/main.js`. Additive + back-filled, no VERSION bump.

## ▶ ACTIVE TASK — L · Accessibility & keyboard input

**#1 refill (2026-07-07):** X and AA both merged (PR #22, #24) — excellent, clean
work. New assignment below, staying in your UX-infrastructure lane.

- **Status:** `IN REVIEW — PR #25` — advancing to queue item 1 (K · itch packaging).
- **Branch:** `claude/keyboard-a11y` (off latest `master`)
- **Owned files (yours):** `js/input.js` *(new)* (+ a small `css/a11y.css` if you
  need focus/skip-link styles — own sheet, link in `<head>`, don't append to `style.css`)
- **Shared (edit minimally):** `js/main.js` (wire the input module once, near the
  other `init*` calls — reuse the existing `tryMove`/modal-close functions, don't
  duplicate them), light `index.html` (ARIA roles/labels on the map grid + modals;
  a skip link).
- **Goal:** make the game keyboard-playable and screen-reader-friendlier —
  **arrow/WASD** move to the adjacent tile (reuse `tryMove`), **Esc** closes the
  open modal, **digit keys** open the nav panels, a `:focus-visible` audit (build
  on the polish-pass ring), and ARIA roles/labels on the map + the seven-plus modals.
- **⚠ Coordinate with Task Z (mobile/touch, owner #2):** Z also adds map
  interaction + a `main.js` input hook and may add a nav dock. Keep **keyboard**
  (yours) and **touch** (Z) in **separate modules/hunks** and note your exact
  `main.js` wiring line in your Worker Log so #1 can rebase whichever lands second.
  You two don't need to sync directly — just stay in your own files.
- **Verify (cloud — no localhost):** headless (key→move maps to `tryMove`; Esc
  closes) + real Chromium (arrow keys move ☯, Esc closes a modal, focus ring
  visible on Tab, 0 console errors). Tell the author how to run locally in the PR.

## ⏭ QUEUE (do next — no need to wait on #1)

1. ~~**K · Itch.io packaging & store page**~~ — ✅ **IN REVIEW — PR #29**
   (`claude/itch-packaging`). Done — advancing to Q.
2. ~~**Q · Sect disciple missions**~~ — ✅ **IN REVIEW — PR #31**
   (`claude/sect-missions`). Done — footprint even smaller than planned (no
   `index.html`: self-injects button + modal + stylesheet like `crafting.js`).

**⚑ QUEUE EMPTY — @#1 please refill.** All assigned tasks shipped & in review:
X (#22✔merged), AA (#24✔merged), L (#25✔merged), K (#29), Q (#31). Idle and ready
for the next assignment — drop it in the ACTIVE TASK slot and I'll pick it up. Per
protocol I'm **not** grabbing a board row myself. Suggested fits for my UX/systems
lane if useful: **W · combat juice**, **Y · item-comparison tooltips**,
**T · fight replay & share**, or **R · world events** — your call.

*(When the queue empties, ping #1 for a refill — don't grab a board row yourself.)*

## ✅ COMPLETED THIS SESSION

- **X · Unified toast / feedback system** — **MERGED, PR #22** (`claude/toast-system`).
- **AA · Theme system (light/dark)** — **MERGED, PR #24** (`claude/theme-system`).

## Worker Log (append-only, newest first — you own this section)

- [2026-07-07] Queue item 2 **Q · Sect disciple missions IN REVIEW — PR #31**
  (`claude/sect-missions` → `master`). `js/sectmissions.js` + `css/sectmissions.css`:
  🗺 Sect Dispatch modal, timed wall-clock disciple missions returning stones+XP,
  behind a `SectMissionProvider` (created in `createGame`). Reads
  `state.guildProvider.getMembers()` — **no guild.js edit**. Offline-safe (endsAt
  vs now, resolved in the per-second tick). Additive `player.sectMissions`
  ({active,tray}, lazy back-fill, no VERSION bump). **Footprint smaller than
  planned — NO `index.html`**: self-injects its button + modal + stylesheet like
  `crafting.js`. **Rebase heads-up for #1:** `game.js` (import + provider line in
  `createGame` after `bountyProvider` + 3 wrappers after the bounty wrappers);
  `main.js` (import + `initSectMissions` near the other inits +
  `updateSectMissionBadge` in `renderAll` + one `tickSectMissions(state)` line in
  the per-second interval). Verified headless + real Chromium (assign→tick→collect).
  **Queue now empty — requested a refill above.**

- [2026-07-07] Queue item 1 **K · Itch.io packaging IN REVIEW — PR #29**
  (`claude/itch-packaging` → `master`). Added `docs/STORE.md` (paste-ready itch
  store page + zip/upload steps), `LICENSE` (MIT © 2026 tarnos12 — flagged in the
  PR as a default to confirm), refreshed `README.md` (Stage 3 status + Controls +
  Build/Publish + License sections), and Open Graph/Twitter `<meta>` in
  `index.html` `<head>` (favicon/title/theme-color untouched). Verified: head
  integrity, the documented `zip` produces a working index.html+css+js bundle,
  page boots in real Chromium with 0 errors. **Rebase heads-up for #1:** only the
  `<head>` overlaps shared space, and only as added `<meta>` lines. **Advancing to
  queue item 2 (Q · Sect disciple missions, branch `claude/sect-missions`).**

- [2026-07-07] Task L **IN REVIEW — PR #25** (`claude/keyboard-a11y` → `master`).
  Shipped `js/input.js` + `css/a11y.css`: arrow/WASD move (reuses `onTileClick`),
  Esc closes the top modal, digits 1–9 open `#nav-menu` panels (queried live),
  guards for typing/modifiers/modal-open; `applyA11y()` sets role/aria on the map
  + every overlay (in JS, covers runtime-injected modals); skip link + `.sr-only`
  + `.tile:focus-visible` in `a11y.css`. No `ui.js`/`combat.js`/`style.css` edit,
  no save fields. Verified headless + real Chromium (arrow moves ☯ 0,0→1,0, digit
  opens codex, Esc closes, skip link focuses map, 0 errors).
  **@#2 (Task Z, mobile/touch) — coordination:** my ENTIRE `main.js` footprint is
  (1) `import { initInput } from './input.js';` and (2) ONE line at the very end of
  the init block, right after `initSettings();`:
  `initInput({ move: (dx, dy) => onTileClick(state.pos.x + dx, state.pos.y + dy) });`
  Keyboard logic is all in `js/input.js`; put your touch handler in your own module
  and add your own single wiring line — we won't share a handler, so whichever of
  L/Z lands second is a trivial both-add rebase for #1. `index.html`: I add a
  skip-link `<a>` (first body child) + one `<link>` in `<head>`.
  **Advancing to K · Itch.io packaging (branch `claude/itch-packaging`) now.**

- [2026-07-07] Queue item 1 **AA · Theme system IN REVIEW — PR #24**
  (`claude/theme-system` → `master`). Shipped `js/theme.js` + `css/theme.css`:
  `data-theme` on `<html>`, dark stays the `style.css` `:root` default, light
  palette = token overrides under `:root[data-theme="light"]` in `theme.css`
  (loaded after `style.css`) + targeted surface fixes for hardcoded colours
  (control fills, combat-log inset, player glyph, body gradient) — **no
  `style.css` edit**. Theme in its own localStorage key (not the save schema);
  inline `<head>` bootstrap sets `data-theme` pre-paint (no flash). Toggle
  self-injects into the ⚙ Settings modal; `settings.js` just calls
  `initThemeControl()`. Verified headless + real Chromium (tokens/panels/controls/
  text reskin, persist, pre-paint, 0 errors). **Rebase heads-up for #1:**
  `index.html` `<head>` gets a `<link>` + a 1-line bootstrap `<script>`;
  `settings.js` gets one import + one call at the top of `initSettings()`.
  Queue now empty — requested a refill above.
- [2026-07-07] Task X **IN REVIEW — PR #22** (`claude/toast-system` → `master`).
  Shipped `js/toast.js` + `css/toast.css`: queue-based `toast(msg,type)` (info/
  success/warn/error), cap 3 concurrent + pump, ~3.5s auto-dismiss, click-to-
  dismiss, `textContent`-only, `aria-live`/`role` + reduced-motion.
  **Achievements-toast coordination decision:** `achievements.js` is out of my
  file scope, so I did **not** edit/absorb it — instead I **matched its visual
  language** (panel card + coloured left accent + slide/fade) and put my toasts
  in a **separate `#toast-host` anchored top-centre** so the two never overlap
  (achievements stay bottom-right). Wired ~6 `main.js` callsites (combat drops/
  cards/breakthrough in `onAttack`, Qi error in `onTileClick`, market-buy +
  bounty accept/claim). No `ui.js` touch, no `style.css` append, no save fields.
  Verified headless (queue) + real Chromium (E2E, 0 console errors). Shared-file
  rebase heads-up for #1: `index.html` `<head>` gets one `<link>`; `main.js` gets
  an import pair + `initToasts()` + small edits inside the pavilion/bounty/attack
  handlers — all well-separated hunks. **Advancing to queue item 1 (AA · Theme
  system, branch `claude/theme-system`) now.**
